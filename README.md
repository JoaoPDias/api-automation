# API Challenge — João Paulo Dias
Hello, my name is João Paulo Dias and I did this challenge aiming to be your Senior QA Engineer. I love programming and testing, therefore I love to automate testing scenarios
## What the project is about and why the language and tools selected
This project is responsible for automating API testing on [Reqres.in](https://reqres.in/) using Typescript, Jest and Supertest. These three were selected because they can be easily implemented with npm supporting and some configurations and they are well-known frameworks, with recent updated and a large support community.

## How to set it up
I prepare a to-do list:

- Install Node JS with npm package [acessing here](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Once installed, use your IDE to open the folder api-automation.
- Open the Terminal in the folder project, type ```npm install```
- With these steps done, we are ready to execute the tests.

## How to execute it
- Keeps in Terminal with the folder project opened and type ```npm test``` and you will see the tests running and logging informations that are requirements.
